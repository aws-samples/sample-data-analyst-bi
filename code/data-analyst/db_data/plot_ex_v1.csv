show the  bar charts for the sales of store 20,"<sample_data>

The question asks to plot bar charts for sales for store number 20.  From the <sample_data></sample_data> tag, the relevant columns are 'Week', 'Weekly_Sales'.The data is filtered for all the entities. So the data is not required to be filtered","def plot_grouped_bar(file1):
    #file1 :  'sql_db_out.csv'
    # No filters on the data are required
   ## Import all the libraries inside the function definition

     import os
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

     file_path = '/home/ec2-user/SageMaker/data_analyst/db_data'
    
    ##Step0: load the files
     df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(file_path, file1)
    ## As the data is already filtered for Store 10 and the given timeperiod, further filtering is not required. So create the plot
     ax.bar(df['Week'], df['Weekly_Sales'])
     ax.set_xlabel('Week')
     ax.set_ylabel('Weekly Sales')
     ax.set_title('Sales for Store 10')

## Set the file names to pass to the function:
file1 = 'sql_db_out.csv'

## Call the function with the relevant report file names to get the results
plot_out = plot_grouped_bar(file1)
